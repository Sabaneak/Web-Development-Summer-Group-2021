# Web-Development-Summer-Group-2021

Hey Everyone,
Welcome!

We're going to start our course by July 8th. The first part of our course will be focused on the basics of HTML. A detailed plan for the upcoming week will be put up tomorrow. But in general, here's how the course is going to go: We'll be having broad topics that we will cover over the course of one week. For each of those topics, you will be provided with resources daily, so you can work through them easily, without feeling overwhelmed. Add the end of each week, you will be given a task or small project to work on, based on what you have learnt the previous week. And at the end of the course, you will be given a big project, that combines all of what you have learnt through this course.

Before we begin:
Install any editor of you choice (VS Code preferably [https://code.visualstudio.com/download])
If you are using VS Code then install this super helpful extension [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer&fbclid=IwAR3rBMbr7SZx-Qzu5DfrFjMqLWNTknyhuVBDsyutBHLKAg8ce5kpn1k5WvY]

That's it for now!
Throughout this course you will face difficulties. Never forget, Google is your best friend here. Always try solving any problem that arises yourself(with Google) first. If that doesn't work never hesitate to reach out to any of the Web Dev instructors
