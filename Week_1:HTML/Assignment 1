#Assignment 1

The assignment will be of 30 points. You can also get a score above 30, if you attempt the bonus points section correctly. 
The solution will be posted once the submission of the assignment has closed. It covers almost everything you have learnt in the past week, so brush on your concepts before you attempt it. 
You will also need a lot of help from Google. Upload your assignment either on codepen (https://www.codepen.io) or jsFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net) and submit the link of your assignment in the form. 
Some of these tasks may seem hard, but you have all the required information. Please attempt an submission at this assignment as further submissions will be considered only if you have submitted this one.

#YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
1. Create and properly markup a letter as shown in the image. You will be judged on how close the your page is to the one that is shown, and the proper use of both structural and inline semantic tags. (The address should be marked up using the address element).
2. Supply proper meta data for the page. You should provide using the proper tags and attributes, the character set, your name as the author and a short description.

#BONUS POINTS:
1. Create an image hyperlink at the end of the page, that when clicked, takes you back to the top of the page.
